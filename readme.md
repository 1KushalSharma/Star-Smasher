Hello Everybody , I made a 2D game star smasher using the unity game engine and C# Scripts along with some premade assets from gamedev.tv!! Now the game is a bit buggy and consists of 5 levels , you have to prevent the ball from falling and break all the blocks and win the game 
Incase you wanna play the game : https://play.unity.com/mg/other/star-smasher this is the browser version
Although for a smoother experience I recommend downloading and running it on your machine.
